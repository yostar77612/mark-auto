# M2 autonomous decisions

## M2-0 / prerequisite evidence — 2026-11-01 12:04–12:12 Asia/Taipei

- Evidence supplied by the coordinating agent: after `git fetch origin`, main
  was `0453136`; specification PR #124 was OPEN at `07d3cc9` on
  `origin/claude/m2-spec`. Both `gh pr list --state all --head
  codex/fix-market-settings` and `git ls-remote --heads origin
  '*market-settings*'` returned no matching prerequisite.
- Decision: start only independent M2-0 and M2-6. M2-1/M2-2 remain unstarted
  until explicit merge evidence for the market-settings prerequisite is
  available. Do not infer completion from a missing branch or merge main.
- Scope: this worktree owns only M2-0. The specification remains implementation
  guidance, not evidence that M2 execution features have been delivered.

## M2-0 / D1 policy and historical boundaries — 2026-11-01 Asia/Taipei

- Authority: owner decision D1 dated 2026-11-01 in
  `origin/claude/m2-spec:docs/design/m2-sinopac-sim-auto-trading-spec.md`.
- Alternatives: retain the old product-wide permanent prohibition; suggest an
  immediate LIVE toggle; or distinguish the v1 research/Paper contract from
  the authorized v2 roadmap. Choose the last: production orders are disabled
  by default, future enablement needs a separate explicit owner decision,
  and M2 continues to hard-disable production orders. The v1 real-order ban
  remains permanent. SinoPac simulation orders are authorized for subsequent
  M2-2 implementation and verification, not enabled by this policy-only PR.
- Update README, contributor safety/mission guidance, the upgrade contract,
  all six ADR policy statements, the glossary and PR risk checklist. Preserve
  historical dates, evidence, budgets, scopes and immutable records. Append
  the current policy to IMPLEMENTATION_CONTRACTS without rewriting its frozen
  historical contracts.
- The passive banner has two existing, deliberately equivalent records:
  `ui.init.research_mode_banner` and `header.live_disabled`. Apply the single
  authorized wording delta, `研究模式・實盤停用` → `研究模式・正式下單停用`, to both;
  do not add or renumber catalog/alias records. Existing HeaderTests require
  equality. Retain the original `ui.__init__.text_3` alias and all provenance.
- Baseline updates belong to a separate commit with this D1 reason. Preserve
  historical source identities and exact unchanged values; admit only this
  banner delta and the ADR safety-policy phrase. Do not regenerate fixtures,
  accept arbitrary current inventories, remove tests or relax safety checks.
- Verification status: focused checks pending during implementation. The
  coordinating agent owns serial full discovery, isolated LOCAL/fake
  BROKER_SIMULATION launch checks, push/PR creation and remote CI. No passing
  full suite, actual broker verification or CI result is inferred here.

## M2-0 / graph and focused verification — 2026-11-01 Asia/Taipei

- Worktree/base: `.worktrees/m2-policy`, `codex/m2-0-policy`, main `0453136`.
  Installed GitNexus 1.6.12 `status` initially reported no index. Offline
  `analyze --index-only` completed in 100.8 seconds with 19,448 nodes,
  51,674 edges and 629 reported flows. Its process-extraction cap warnings are
  not interpreted as proof of absent flows. No extensions were downloaded.
- Upstream impact ran before editing both string ENTRIES records and the
  affected ADR/glossary/alias/R7 test methods. Each reported UNKNOWN/zero
  resolved callers. Direct source and text searches confirmed the static
  translation_parts → catalog_data → catalog assembly, AppHeader badge and
  disclosure consumers, exact header-equality assertion, and unittest
  discovery methods. UNKNOWN was resolved with that evidence, not read as low.
- Source graph change analysis completed: 24 symbols in 14 tracked files,
  zero reported affected processes, low risk, no partial/truncation flag.
  This bounded graph result supplements direct diff and tests.
- Pinned Ruff check/format passed for both changed Python source files.
  `python -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_header_c1.py -v` passed all
  six tests in 2.041 seconds. Exact baseline assertions are intentionally
  updated only in the following, separate D1 baseline commit.


## M2-0 / completed verification and owner follow-up — 2026-11-01T14:57+08:00

- The owner's follow-up assigns the absent market-settings prerequisite to
  this run and permits dependent implementation after its own green CI,
  without a main merge. PR #129 reached all35 SUCCESS on run41279585267,
  attempt2, exact2d8319b. M2-1/M2-2 now proceed in separate worktrees.
  This supersedes the initial wait-for-merge decision; it does not enable
  LIVE or authorize second-round automatic trading.
- Final complete M2-0 discovery on unchanged97e2a8b: 3,888 tests in 2,380.898 s; FAILED (failures=10, errors=27, skipped=42).
  No new failure identities; all actual traceback differences were reviewed.
  Preserve the nonzero main-host result honestly. The initial new smoke-marker
  failure passed on this complete unchanged retry; the separate incomplete
  permission-loop attempt is excluded rather than called a pass.
- Use normal user execution for later full suites after diagnosing the
  restricted-run tempfile retry. Do not change test limits, Windows policy,
  ACLs, application code or dependencies to hide that harness mistake.
- Actual LOCAL and fake BROKER_SIMULATION windows returned0 and released their
  owned resources. Source PR128 had35/35 CI success; final documentation-head
  CI is verified separately before delivery. Evidence and limitations are in
  docs/analysis/m2-policy/verification.md and its companion files.
- This commit adds verification documentation only. No product/test/fixture
  behavior, G3 source, SDK pin, PROJECT_STATE or acceptance score changes.
